Whenever I would share my excellent performance in math and science classes, as well as my interest in coding, with my family, friends, and even strangers, I would receive the same robotic response: "You should consider becoming a Data Scientist." Yet, no one ever took the time to explain to me what Data Science was, what a job as a Data Scientist entailed, or why the Harvard Business Review labeled the profession as "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century"? 
Understanding data Science took parts and pieces, and each experience unveiled a distinctive aspect of the field, amazing me even more. From a guest speaker in ninth grade, I uncovered that at its core, Data Science is the study of data to gain insights and reveal trends; from my parents, I learned how the success of a company depends on its ability to analyze these patterns and make decisions to represent consumer needs; from a Database Fundamentals course, I learned how to model data by building relational databases in SQL, retrieving and manipulating that data using queries; from Harvard Business Review, I discovered the expansion of Data Science to encompass Artificial Intelligence, like generative AI models. 
Data Science is boundless-regardless of the field, there remains a necessity for information to be sorted, scrutinized, and summarized. I hope to one day utilize and manipulate data to enhance space research and classify planetary bodies beyond the current scope, expanding on the Hipparcos database for nearby stars.
