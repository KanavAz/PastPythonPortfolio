When I see universities without a Data Science program or only having Data Analytics-which is not the same as Data Science-I am not enraged, outraged, or even vexed-just disappointed. 
That was satire.
In seriousness, despite being in a generation characterized by the exponential growth of data and technology, Purdue remains one of the few institutions updating their curriculum to encompass these advancements; the Integrative Data Science Initiative (IDSI) supplies all students, regardless of major, with vital data literacy and analysis skills, fostering an environment of data-conscious individuals. With courses like Data Mining & Machine Learning and Large Scale Data Analytics, I can propel my capabilities to discern insights from large datasets, employ predictive and descriptive modeling, and construct analysis algorithms. Beyond the academic opportunities, the Indianapolis location at Purdue offers proximity to internships and workplace experiences in the city, as many companies utilize data to analyze consumer patterns or, more recently, are working towards implementing Artificial Intelligence like Eli Lilly for modeling these trends.
While pursuing a degree in Data Science at Purdue, I hope to be a member of the C. Richard Petticrew Forum. Being a member of my high school speech and debate team for three years, I have realized how effectively the nuances of my voice can express the essence of my message. Through competing in interpretative, limited preparation, or general address individual speaking events (IEs), I aspire to not only advance my speaking technique at a competitive level-but also mature as a communicator.
